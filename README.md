# Generative Art with Moving Points

This Python script creates an abstract generative art piece using OpenCV and numpy. The artwork is generated by moving several colored points across a 2D space. Each pixel's color in the frame is determined by its distance to each point. The points move around the frame at random speeds and directions, leading to evolving patterns over time.

## Requirements

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- `random`
- `math`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

The script generates a video file named `output.mp4` which displays the generative artwork. By default, it runs for 60 seconds at a frame rate of 30 FPS, resulting in a video of 1800 frames.

You can customize the following parameters in the script:

- `width`, `height`: Dimensions of the output frame (default: 1280x720).
- `evolutionRate`: Speed at which the points move (default: 5.0).
- `numPoints`: Number of points that will be generated (default: 4).
- `multiplier`: Factor by which the distance from each pixel to the point influences the final color of the pixel (default: 5).
- `seconds`: Duration of the simulation in seconds (default: 60).
- `fps`: Frames per second of the output video (default: 30).

You can simply run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python3 psychedelic.py
```

## How It Works

The main concept behind this script is to use distance matrices to generate color values for each pixel. For each point, a distance matrix is calculated where each element represents the distance of the corresponding pixel to the point. The color of a pixel is determined by the sum of the product of each point's color and its corresponding distance. The points move around the frame with a speed determined by the `evolutionRate`, creating an evolving pattern over time.

## Note

This script is for generating abstract, evolving color patterns as a form of art, and does not have any practical use case beyond this.

Enjoy the beautiful generative artwork!
